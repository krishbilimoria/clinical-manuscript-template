# EBMLive 2022: Meeting the needs of diverse stakeholders: towards interactive manuscripts

Preliminary draft of rMarkdown template for clinical studies. Includes:
1. Manuscript headers
2. Sample implementations of tables
3. Sample implementations of commonly used graphs in clinical research

* Conference supplemental information: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ikzAsFcXqvO3Hdju6AtbNsqrw_1N7ZgRJ3pgi2pU82Y/edit?usp=sharing 
* Conference abstract: https://ebm.bmj.com/content/27/Suppl_2/A15.2?fbclid=IwAR3eXrSBxH40NVGwFssYuUXbxpfEc31VqyX4H4PHF5c5f8M-pPwAExSzScg 

Next steps:
1. Types of clinical article templates: build specific templates for specific types of studies (case study, case series, cohort study, case-control study, randomized control trial, systematic review, meta-analysis), with their accompanying tables and figures.
2. Educational videos: build out a series of educational videos for users of this template to learn how to navigate & adapt the template for their own purposes. Presuming basic level of R competence from template users.
3. Consult with research software engineers (or anyone far more cleverer than me at R): clean up code, identify and resolve inefficiencies.
4. Submit to CRAN for inclusion in the 'rticles' package.

Disclaimers:
1. Much of template.tex code heavily adapted from prior iterations of rticles packages (PLoS 2018), with the intent to contribute back to existing rticles package once integration is complete.
2. Vignettes of available graphs adapted from the underlying educational vignettes of each of the tools.
